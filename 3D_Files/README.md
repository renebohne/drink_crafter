* compact_cocktailmaschinbe.scad is the source code for OpenScad.

* compact_cocktailmaschine.stl is just for reference - DON'T PRINT THIS! You will not be able to mount pumps or components into this all-in-one model. You need to print the two parts: blue and red - see below!

* First, you should print pumpfit_test.stl and check if your pumps fit the design.

* compact_blue.stl is the inner construction. Use it for eight pumps and one ESP32 controller board and some wiring. It has some space for tubes.

* compact_red.stl is the shell. It is not so important, but it hides the inside. In the future, a skilled designer might create a pull-request with a very nice shell design. Today it is just a box.

* top.stl might fit on top of the shell. I did not print it yet.
